Hi. Welcome to Calculatorus-Rex ðŸ¦–.

This is a string based calculator. The whole operation must be in a single string format as shown in the following examples. You may also refer to the test file which shows the tests step by step, so it's like a running documentation.

Example #1: 
Input: ''
Output: 0

Example #2:
Input: '6'
Output: 6

Example #3:
Input: '6,9'
Output: 15

Example #4:
Input: '6,9,4'
Output: 19

Example #5:
Input: '6,9\n4,2'
Output: 21
