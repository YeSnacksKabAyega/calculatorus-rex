Hi. Welcome to Calculatorus-Rex ðŸ¦–.

This is a string based calculator. The whole operation must be in a single string format as shown in the following examples. You may also refer to the test file which shows the tests step by step, so it's like a running documentation.

Example #1: 
Input: ""
Output: 0

Example #2:
Input: "6"
Output: 6
